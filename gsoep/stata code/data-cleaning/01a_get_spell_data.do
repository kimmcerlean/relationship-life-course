**# Relationship history files
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************

// various relationship history files - figure out if partnership history includes marital history or if these are mutually exclusive? okay def includes marital, and even non-cohab relationships
// the challenge is the monthly files are only prospective, and the partnership history that includes cohabitation and is retrospective did not start until 2011

********************************************************************************
**# BIOCOUPLY
*** Couple year, all relationships, retrospective (since year of birth)
*** This is the IDEAL file, but is not comprehensive because only covers people
*** who answered after wave 28
*** But let's use this as main file and then figure out how to use the other 
*** files to supplement
